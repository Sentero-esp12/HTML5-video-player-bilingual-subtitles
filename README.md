# HTML5 video player bilingual subtitles
 An in-browser player to watch videos with double subtitles


Only supports video formats supported by the browser, but maybe it could be turned into a desktop application with more supported formats.

1. Add video (drag or click "Choose file" on the left)
2. Add subtitles (drag or click "Choose file" in the middle)
3. Use the in-browser page translator tool (Chrome), or a page translator extension (Firefox) to translate the page. After that subtitles will be translated.
4. Click "AddSecondLang" button on the top left.
5. Return the translated page to the original language (in Chrome click the translate icon in the address bar and choose the original language). 


Controls:
- "Space", click to stop the video.
- Arrow up/down to regulate the volume.
- 'h' to hide everything except the video.
- '<' '>' to change the timing of subtitles by 0.1s.
- 'w' to rewind to the beginning of the current caption.
- 'e' to rewind to the beginning of the previous caption.
- 'r' to rewind to the next caption.
- 's' to rewind 0.5s back.


Use a pop up translator like this: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/myvocabu/fcoakpbajjmgoheogkoblfhbbdacjdjm
to translate words from subtitles.
